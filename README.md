I built this application to gain experience with React and to better understand its differences compared to Angular. It is not a finished project, however; the main focus was on learning to develop the "React way" and experimenting with some popular libraries.

The application was built with the following technologies and libraries:
- React 18
- Express (a very lightweight backend as the focus was on the client side)
- Redux (Redux Saga for effect handling)
- Axios
- Zod
- React Hook Form
- Tailwind
- Material UI

I initially planned to use OpenAPI (Swagger) for generating models, but due to limited time I had to postpone this idea. Perhaps in the future, Iâ€™ll integrate it along with a more robust backend.
